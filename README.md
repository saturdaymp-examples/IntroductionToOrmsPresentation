# Introduction to ORMs Presentation
Presentation and examples that introduce ORM concepts to developers.  The theory applies to most ORMs but the examples focus on Enitty Framework.

# Demo Quickstart
The demos where inspired by the Entity Framework Core [demos](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/get-started/netcore/new-db-sqlite).

To run the demos download and install [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com)  (there is a free community version).  You can install Visual Studio on Windows or Mac.  You will also need [.NET Core 2.1](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download).  

Finally you will need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/docker-community) to run the database instance.

# Feedback
